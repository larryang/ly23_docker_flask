    <h1>Using Git</h1>

    <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is the project's distributed version control system (VCS). It is an Open
        Source Software (OSS) from the people behind Linux, and it uses the
        <a href=https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0">GPL-2.0</a> license. Even though it is a distributed VCS, this
        project uses <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> as the main repository.</p>

    <h2>Git Terminology and Concepts</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Branch</dt>
        <dd>A separate isolated workspace that allows a developer to diverge from the main or master source,
            allowing changes to be made without affecting others working on the same line. The top level parent
            branch is usually referred to "master" or "main". This concept common to various version control
            systems.
        </dd>
        <dt>Merge</dt>
        <dd>Used to put the changes from one branch to another branch. Usually, the merge requires
            a multiple file comparison between the source, destination, and final version. If the source branch has
            its parent on the destination branch, and the source branch has not changed, this is called a
            "fast-forward", as this just involves moving the branch tip/pointer.
        </dd>
        <dt>Commit</dt>
        <dd>Each version or "save" of the branch. Each commit is identified with a cryptographic hash, and
            corresponds with the more general idea of a changeset, the smallest unit of changes in a version
            control system. A commit is created after the changes have been added via "add" command, then "commit"
            command.
        </dd>
        <dt>Tag</dt>
        <dd>A unique text label applied to a commit. Multiple labels may be applied the commit</dd>
        <dt>Repository</dt>
        <dd>An set of local files in a directory, that tracks the changes, versions, branches, tags, and associated
            metadata. Everyone has a local repository, i.e. a local isolated copy of this information. To share
            changes, repositories can be shared and synchronized over a network, by commands such as "push",
            "pull", and "fetch". Since git is a distributed system, a central repository does not exist, but can be
            enforced via convention. Such a central repository can be provided as a service. This project uses
            <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, with the main repository at
            <a href="https://github.com/larryang/ly23_docker_flask">
                https://github.com/larryang/ly23_docker_flask</a></dd>
